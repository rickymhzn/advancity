                         Degrees in America are expensive, but an abundance of scholarships are available to help
                         international students out. Almost all universities have scholarship programs, most of which
                         are open to applications from international students â€“ although you may need to take SAT/ACT,
                         GRE/GMAT tests. According to the Fulbright Commission, more than 600 American universities
                         offer scholarships worth $20,000 or more up-to 100% to international students. They are
                         typically assessed on academic merit, financial need, or extracurricular contribution.
